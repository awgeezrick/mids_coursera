# Class Two: Representing Data: Sets, Dictionaries, and Numpy

## Overall learning objectives (mapped to specialization learning objectives):
- Introduce data structures for representing data
- Learn programming practices (vectorization, subsetting) for matrices
- Describe the components and packages of the Python ecosystem

## WEEK ONE

(Drew and Genevieve)

## WEEK TWO

- Theme: Welcome to arrays and matrices, the foundational data structures for computation
- Learning objectives: 
  - Understand why arrays are key to data science; 
  - learn basics of subsetting and manipulating arrays

### Overview

- Data science stack: Python -> numpy -> pandas

### Data structures for computation (numpy)

- **Why numpy**
  - Easier to use for computational programming
  - Faster than equivalent operations using Python lists
  - Wide array of mathematical functions available in the library
  - Integrates nicely with many other computational and plotting packages
- **Importing Packages**
  - But not management -- want already installed. 
- **Vectors**
  - Why vectors? (for science, need multiple measurements of any outcome!)
  - What is vector? (single-typed, concept of order)
  - Vector math / operations (modelled [after this?](https://cm4ss.com/html/intro_to_vectors.html))
  - Subsetting vectors (by index, by logicals) (modelled [after this?](https://cm4ss.com/html/manipulating_vectors.html))
  - Editing vectors

## WEEK THREE

- **Views v. copies**
- **Matrices**
  - Why matrices? (often we want to measure different outcomes for the same units of analysis, so we can stack vectors to make a matrix)
  - Matrix math ([modeled after this?](https://cm4ss.com/html/intro_to_matrices.html))
  - Subsetting matrices: just 2 dimensional extension of vectors ([modeled after this?](https://cm4ss.com/html/manipulating_matrices.html))

## WEEK FOUR

- **Vectorization**
  - Why does it matter?
  - In practice

### Package Management (maybe here maybe not?)

- pip / conda
- Environments: maybe not full tutorial, but demystify / overview
  - conda v. virtualenv v. pyenv
