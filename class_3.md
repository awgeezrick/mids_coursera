## WEEK TWO

- Theme: Welcome to pandas
- Learning objectives: 
    - Understand why we need pandas
    - Be familiar with indices and index alignment, though also in general we will emphasize avoiding them
    - Understand the plotting ecosystem in Python
    - Understand the graphics of grammar
    - Be able to do basic plots in altair

### Working with tabular data of mixed types (pandas)

- **Why pandas?**
  - Heterogenous tables!
  - Easier to work with tabular data 
- **Series**
  - Just a vector with a set of row labels called an index. 
  - Subsetting: `iloc[]` (like numpy) and `loc[]` (uses labels). 
- **DataFrames**
  - Collection of Series. 
  - Summary functions
  - Subsetting ([modeled after this?](https://www.practicaldatascience.org/html/pandas_dataframes.html))

## WEEK THREE

- **Data Formats / Loading Data**
  - JSON, tabular (csv, tsv), plaintext v. binary, etc.
- **The views/copies disaster**
- Cleaning
  - Missing data representations / `pd.isnull()`

### Defensive Programming for Data Analysis

- To err is human
- Tests in ds code
- Style matters (needed? ask D&G)

## WEEK FOUR

### Data Manipulation

- Merging
- Groupby
